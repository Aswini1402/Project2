# Summary of Laptop Prices Dataset Analysis
# Overview

Dataset contains 1,275 records with 23 columns, capturing various aspects of laptop specifications and pricing across multiple brands.

# Key Findings
#  Product & Brand Distribution

Dell is the leading company (291 laptops), followed by HP, Lenovo, and Asus.

Dataset covers 618 unique products and 19 companies.

Most laptops are Notebook type (707 records).

#  Hardware Specifications

Screen Size: Average 15 inches (range 10.1–18.4).

RAM: Average 8 GB (range 2–64 GB).

Weight: Average 2.04 kg (range 0.69–4.7 kg).

Storage:

Primary storage average 445 GB (mostly SSDs).

Many laptops have no secondary storage, but when present, it ranges up to 2 TB.

CPU: Predominantly Intel-based, most common model is Core i5-7200U.

GPU: Largely integrated Intel GPUs (HD Graphics 620 most common).

#  Price Distribution

Average price: ~€1,135

Lowest price: €174

Highest price: €6,099

Majority fall in the €600–€1500 range, indicating a mid-market concentration.

#  Display Features

Resolution: Most laptops feature Full HD (1920×1080).

Touchscreen: Mostly No (85%).

IPS panels: Present in ~28% of laptops.

Retina displays: Very rare (only 17 laptops).

#  Operating Systems

Windows 10 dominates (82% of records).

Other OS options (Linux, macOS, etc.) are less frequent.

Data Completeness and Quality

Dataset has no missing values across all 23 columns.

Categorical variables (like screen type, CPU/GPU models) are diverse but consistent.

Price values and hardware specifications are clean and well-structured.

# Conclusion

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the laptop market, highlighting dominant brands (Dell, HP, Lenovo), mid-range pricing trends, and widespread use of Intel CPUs and integrated GPUs.
It shows clear preferences for 15-inch, Full HD, non-touchscreen notebooks with SSD-based storage and 8GB RAM as the standard.
Future work could explore price prediction models, brand comparisons, and feature importance analysis to better understand what drives laptop pricing.
